This project is part of

kaggle kernel.

**Tensorflow is one of the top deep learning libraries by google. Originally I used 
Pytorch as my major 
but recently I decided to explore tensorflow because it abit smooth to deploy trained 
models to mobile.
It relies on Keras as its high level API. In this code walkthrough am going to use 
[TFHub](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras) with tranfer 
learning to classify fruits.**

I used [Fruit dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits) which is available on 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
